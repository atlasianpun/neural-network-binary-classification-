# Heart Attack Prediction

This project utilizes a neural network to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on various health indicators. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

- The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset?resource=download).
- The data contains features such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trtbps), cholesterol levels (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalachh), exercise-induced angina (exng), oldpeak, slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slp), number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (caa), and thalassemia (thall).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- hyperopt
- tensorflow
- keras
- google-colab (if using Google Colab)

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**: 
    - The dataset is loaded from Google Drive.
    - File path used: `/content/drive/MyDrive/ML/heart.csv`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - The dataset is inspected for any missing values and outliers.
    - Outliers are identified but not removed in the final version.
    - Features are selected and scaled for model training.
    - Data is split into features (X) and labels (Y).

3. **Model Building**: 
    - A neural network is created using Keras.
    - The network consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with dropout, and an output layer.
    - Activation functions used are `relu` for hidden layers and `sigmoid` for the output layer.
    - The model is compiled with `binary_crossentropy` loss function and `adam` optimizer.

4. **Model Training**: 
    - The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
    - The model is trained with the training dataset for 100 epochs.
    - Batch size used for training is 15.

5. **Model Evaluation**: 
    - The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to determine its performance.
    - Metrics such as binary accuracy are used to evaluate the model.

## Summary

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart attacks using machine learning techniques. The neural network model is trained and evaluated to provide insights into its predictive performance based on health indicators.
